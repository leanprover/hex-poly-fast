# General cached remainder trees

`RemainderTree` caches one finite-capacity reciprocal plan at every node of a
balanced tree of nonzero monic leaves.  Traversal returns `none` if the chosen
capacity is insufficient at any node; a successful traversal returns the
canonical-size remainder at every leaf in the original order.
