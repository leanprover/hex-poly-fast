Balanced product trees.

The representation is private: clients observe the original leaves, balanced
levels, and the root product through the accessors below. The root is cached;
level observations are reconstructed on demand. Adjacent nodes are multiplied
with the supplied lawful plan; an unpaired final node is carried to the next
level unchanged.
